# Multilayer-Perceptron-Classifier

This code implements an MLP with one hidden layer using gradient descent for updating the weights. A sample data is given and corresponding train/test sets are prepared before the process in "run_mlp.m".

In the implementation, f(v) is the bipolar sigmoidal function and fder(v) is the derivation of f(v). Least Square Error (LSE) is used to compute error. Corresponding explanations are given in the code with the command lines.
